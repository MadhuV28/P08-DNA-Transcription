# P08-DNA-Transcription
Bioinformatics is the application of computer science techniques to biological problems. In the following
program, you’ll be using a linked queue structure to simulate the process of DNA transcription - since
this isn’t a biology class, I won’t go into depth on anything, but if you’re interested, this is an excellent
primer on the topic.
We’re not interested in the classical double-helix structure here; we’ll just be representing what’s called
the primary structure of the DNA, its nucleotide sequence - the ACGT letters you may have seen before.
From there, we’ll translate to a complementary mRNA sequence, and then take those mRNA sequences
and group them into threes to find the final amino acid sequence that will become a protein.
The goals of this assignment are:
● Explore a basic linked queue implementation
● Practice iterating through a linked list without using an Iterator
● Additional practice with object-oriented programming and unit test development
The source code can be found in the 'P08/src' folder.
